I usually eat a sandwich and drink water. After lunch, I continue with classes until 3:00. When I finish school, I go home. I do my homework and then I play video games. I like play videogames because are fun. At 7:00, I dinner with my family. We talk about our day. After dinner, I watch TV or read a book. I go to bed at 10:00. This is my daily routine.

        "Reflective Questions\n",
        "Analysis of your mistakes\n",
        "\"I get dress\"\n",
        "-\n",
        "Can you think of the correct verb form for ‚Äúdress‚Äù here?\n",
        "You made a mistake with the verb form. \"Dress\" means to put on clothes. But here, you need to use \"get\" with a verb in the past form.\n",
        "Can you think of other phrases with ‚Äúget‚Äù that are similar?\n",
        "\"I like the English\"\n",
        "- What word should you take out of your sentence?\n",
        "- Can you think of other subjects that do not need a word like this?\n",
        "There is a word you do not need to use with school or university subjects. You might have used it because it sounds like a translation from Spanish, where you say \"Me gusta el ingl√©s.\"\n",
        "\"The teacher help me\"\n",
        "- How do you change a verb when the subject is singular?\n",
        "- Can you think of another example of a subject and verb that agree?\n",
        "This is a mistake with verb form. Remember that in present simple, for he, she, or it, the verb changes to match \"the teacher.\"\n",
        "\"in cafeteria\"\n",
        "- Which word do you think we should use here?\n",
        "- Can you think of other places where you might need this word?\n",
        "You need a word before \"cafeteria.\" This will make your idea clearer for the reader to show it is a place you already know.\n",
        "\"I like play video games\"\n",
        "-\n",
        "What verb form do you think you need after \"like\"?\n",
        "Can you think of other verbs of opinion that need a specific form after them?\n",
        "This is a mistake with the verb form after \"like.\" This mistake happens because Spanish sentences are different. You might have two correct options.\n",
        "\"I dinner with my family\"\n",
        "- What verb do we usually use with \"dinner\" in English?\n",
        "- Can you think of other meals that need a similar verb?\n",
        "Dinner is a meal. In English, you also need a verb to show the action. In Spanish, you just say ‚Äúcenar,‚Äù but in English, you need both a verb and the meal.\n",
        "\"Is not very exciting\"\n",
        "- What subject pronoun should you use here?\n",
        "- Why is it important to include subjects in sentences?\n",
        "Here the sentence is not complete. You need to add a subject pronoun at the beginning. This might not be needed in Spanish, so you might have left it out.\n",
        "\"but I like\"\n",
        "- What object pronoun should you use here?\n",
        "- Why do you think the missing pronoun refers to?\n",

        "## Example 2\n",
        "Student: *TEXT* = The Lion King\n",
        "I see the movie \"The Lion King\" last weekend. It is very good movie for children and adults. The story is about a young lion named Simba. He is the son of Mufasa, who is king of the jungle. Simba is very curious and want to explore the world. In the beginning, Mufasa teach Simba about the circle of life. It is very important for animals. But, there is a bad uncle named Scar. He wants to be the king and he makes a plan to kill Mufasa. This part is very sad because Mufasa dies, and Simba feels very guilty. Simba run away and he met two funny animals, Timon and Pumbaa. They become his friend, and they live in a place call the jungle. They teach Simba to have fun and forget his problem. I like Timon because he is very funny and make me laugh. Later, Simba meet Nala, who is his childhood friend. She tells him that Scar is bad king. Simba must return to the Pride Lands to take back his place as king. The animation is very beautiful and the song are amazing. I love the song \"Hakuna Matata\" because it is very cheerful. In conclusion, I recommend \"The Lion King\" to everyone. It is a movie that teach us about responsibility and courage. I give it 5 star out of 5. You will enjoy it a lots!\n",
        "Things you need to fix:\n",
        "Now, let's take a look at the areas where improvements can be made: Errors and Mistakes Reflection Questions Analysis of your mistakes \"I see the movie last weekend\" - What is the past simple form of the verb ‚Äúsee‚Äù? - Does it have an irregular or regular verb form? This is a mistake with verb tenses. In English, we use the past tense for things that happened in the past. \"It is very good movie for children and adults.\" - What article should you use before \"very good movie\"? - Can you think of other examples where this article is needed? In Spanish, articles are used differently than in English. In English, we use \"a\" or \"the\" with nouns. \" Simba is very curious and want to explore the world \" - - How would you change \"want\" to keep the same tense in your movie review? - Why is it important to keep the same tense in your writing? The verb \"want\" should be in the past tense to match the other verbs in your review.\n",
        "Errors and Mistakes Reflection Questions Analysis of your mistakes \"Mufasa teach Simba\" - What verb form should you use with \"Mufasa\"? - Can you think of other sentences where subject-verb agreement is important? This mistake happens when the subject and verb do not agree. In present simple, the verb changes for he, she, or it. In your case, \"Mufasa.\" \"Simba run away\" - What is the past tense of \"run\"? - Is it an irregular or regular verb? This is another mistake with verb tenses. The verb should match the order of events in the past. \"They live in a place call the jungle\" - How would you change \"call\" to past participle? - Is it an irregular or regular verb? You made a grammar mistake. The phrase \"call the jungle\" needs the correct verb form to show the meaning. You need the past participle form of the verb here to indicate that the place has been named as \"the jungle.\" \"I give it 5 star out of 5\" - Was this a typing mistake? - What is the correct plural form of \"star\"? When talking about more than one thing, use the plural form of the noun. \"You will enjoy it a lots!\" - How would you change \"a lots\" to make it correct? You wanted to say that you think the person will enjoy the movie a lot. But \"a lots\" is incorrect.\n",
        "## Example 3\n",
        "Student: *TEXT* = In today‚Äôs world, learning English is very important. Many people think that it is necessary for many reasons. First of all, English is the most spoken language in the world. It is the language of business, science, and technology. For example, if you want to work in a big company, you need to speak English. This is because most of the companies use English to communicate with their clients and employees.\n",
        "Secondly, knowing English can help you to travel around the world. When you go to another country, you can meet many people who speak English. It is easier to ask for directions or to order food in a restaurant. In addition, many tourist information is in English. Therefore, if you don‚Äôt understand English, you can get lost or miss important information.\n",
        "However, some people argue that learning English is not necessary. They believe that it is more important to learn the local language of the country where you live. This is true, but I think that learning English can help you to connect with more people. For instance, if you know English, you can make friends from different countries and cultures.\n",
        "In conclusion, I believe that learning English is very important. It opens many doors for your future, both in your career and in your personal life. Even if you learn a little bit, it can make a big difference. Therefore, everyone should try to learn English, because it is a valuable skill in our globalized world.\n",
        "In my opinion, the advantages of knowing English outweights the disadvantages. I hope that more people will realize the importance of learning this language.\n",
        "Things you need to fix:\n",
        "Now, let‚Äôs talk about some areas where you can improve. Here is a table with your mistakes and some questions to think about: Errors/Mistakes Reflection Questions Possible Reasons for Errors \"many tourist information is in English.\" - How can you write this sentence with the right quantifier? - What other uncountable nouns in English do you know? This mistake is about nouns and quantifiers. \"Tourist information\" is an uncountable noun. \"it can make a big difference.\" - What are some other words for \"make a big difference\" that you could use instead? This sentence is not wrong. However, it repeats ideas in your essay about why learning English is important. \"the advantages of knowing English outweights the disadvantages.\" - Can you find the correct verb form for \"outweigh\"? The reason for this error might be confusion with verb forms. In English, some verbs change their spelling for \"he,\" \"she,\" or \"it.\"\n",

        "Firstly, I would like to know what is the deadline for submitting the applications. I have read on your website that the program starts in September, but I am not sure if the deadline is in June or July.

        "Things you need to fix:\n",
        "Now, let's look at some areas for improvement: Errors and Mistakes Reflection Questions Possible Reasons for Errors \"Master program\" - Can you think of how to correctly use possessive forms in English? - What is the difference between \"Master program\" and \"Master's program\"? In English, we need to indicate possession here. This mistake might have been a direct translation from Spanish, where the word \"m√°ster\" is used. I would like to know what is the deadline for submitting the applications\n",
        "- How can you form an indirect question correctly in your writing? Can you think of other examples of indirect questions and their importance? This sentence has a word order mistake. This might have been influenced by the structure in Spanish, where the order can remain the same in both direct and indirect questions. However, this is not the case in English. In direct questions, we often use the order: question word + verb + subject. For example: \"What is the deadline?\" However, in indirect questions, the order changes to: question word + subject + verb. \"I would appreciate if you could provide me with details\" - What pronoun is necessary in this case? - What other phrases might require a similar structure? The problem here is that the object pronoun is omitted after ‚Äúappreciate‚Äù which is something common when translating from Spanish: ‚Äúapreciar√≠a si puede darme los detalles..‚Äù \"I am not sure if the deadline is in June or July.\" - What other word instead of ‚Äúif‚Äù might be more appropriate in formal writing? - Can you think of other instances in your writing where you used \"if\" instead of a more formal formulation? Your sentence is grammatically correct, but it could be improved for clarity and formality in a formal email. This might be influenced by a more casual use of \"if\" in everyday conversation, which can sometimes carry over into writing. \"I would like to know if there are opportunities for internships during the program.\" - How can you turn your statement into a direct question to sound more concise while still being polite? This sentence is correct, but you could make it more concise by perhaps formulating a direct question here.\n",

        "*TEXT* = My First Time in the City\n",
        "Last summer, I had my first time to go to a big city. I was very excited because I never went to a big city before. I went to Madrid with my family. We traveled by train, and the journey was very long, but I enjoyed it because I saw many beautiful landscapes. When we arrived to Madrid, I was surprised. The city is very big and noisy. There were many people and cars everywhere. My mother said to me, \"Look at the buildings! They are very tall!\" I took many photos because I wanted to remember this moment. The first place we visited was a famous museum. I never saw so many paintings in my life! I liked the art, but some paintings were strange. My father explained to me about the artists, and I learned a lot. After the museum, we went to a park. It was very nice and green. I saw many flowers and trees. In the evening, we ate dinner in a restaurant. I tried a traditional dish called \"paella.\" It was delicious! I have never eaten something like that before. I was happy because I could taste new food. Finally, we returned to our hotel. I was very tired but very happy. I slept very well that night. This experience was special for me because it was my first time in a big city. I hope to go back to Madrid again!\n",
